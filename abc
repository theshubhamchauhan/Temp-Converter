**Subject:** Request for Work-from-Home Until Credentials Are Provided  

Dear [Manager’s Name],  

I hope you are doing well. I wanted to bring to your attention that currently, we are not able to contribute productively in the office due to the lack of work assigned to us. We are eager to make the best use of our time, especially by completing relevant certifications that would enhance our skills and benefit the team.  

However, many of the websites we need for these certifications are restricted in the office network, making it difficult for us to proceed. If granted the flexibility to work from home, we can efficiently complete these certifications using our personal laptops and upload them to the portal for approval. This will not only keep us engaged but also ensure that we utilize this period effectively while awaiting our credentials.  

We genuinely want to make the most of our time and continue growing in our roles. We kindly request you to consider allowing us to work from home until our credentials are provided. This would enable us to stay productive and return with enhanced skills that align with the organization’s goals.  

We would really appreciate your support in this matter. Looking forward to your positive response.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
